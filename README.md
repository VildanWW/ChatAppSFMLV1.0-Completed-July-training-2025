# SimpleChat v1.0 — InProgress

## What’s done

- ◦ TCP server connection using SFML  
- ◦ Sending and receiving messages  
- ◦ Displaying others’ messages on the left, own messages on the right (using Dear ImGui)  
- ◦ Multithreading and data safety with mutex  
- ◦ Message input field with sending on Enter key  
- ◦ Basic client architecture implemented as a ClientLib library

## Why am I sharing this project?

- ◦ To show how I learned to build a simple network chat with a graphical interface  
- ◦ To keep track of my progress and development in C++ and GUI programming  
- ◦ Maybe it can help someone looking for a minimal example of network interaction with ImGui  

## Should you use this project as a base for commercial or large applications?

- I don’t recommend using this code in real products without improvements  
- But if you’re curious about how to make a minimal functional chat — welcome to explore!  

## What’s planned next?

- ◦ Rewrite the client using ASIO for better network performance  
- ◦ Use Qt for a more powerful and commercially viable GUI  
- ◦ Add user authentication, display of usernames, message history, and more  

## Disclaimer

This is my first attempt at creating a networked app with a graphical interface — the architecture and code style are far from perfect. But it’s a step forward in learning network programming and UI development.
